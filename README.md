# üöÄ MLOps Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to my **MLOps Bootcamp** repository!  
This repository includes all **homeworks, mini-projects, and the final project** completed as part of an intensive, hands-on MLOps training program.

Throughout the bootcamp, I explored a wide range of topics ‚Äî from Linux and Docker to model deployment with FastAPI, MLflow, Streamlit, Terraform, and Ansible. Each week's work builds toward mastering the end-to-end MLOps lifecycle.

## üìö Content Overview

### Week 1: Linux Basics
- Practiced essential Linux commands and file system operations.
- Downloaded datasets, edited files via terminal, and installed CLI tools like `tree`.

### Week 2: SQL & Docker-Compose
- Deployed **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** using Docker Compose.
- Created databases and users, performed CRUD operations using SQL scripts.

### Week 3: JupyterLab, EDA & MLflow
- Created a Conda environment and ran JupyterLab on a custom port.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on housing data.
- Tracked and compared multiple regression models using **MLflow**.

### Week 4: FastAPI Basics & CRUD Operations
- Built REST APIs using **FastAPI**:
  - Created a basic arithmetic endpoint.
  - Performed CRUD operations on customer data in a MySQL database.
  - Implemented secure password handling.

### Week 5: ML Model Development & FastAPI Deployment
- Developed a churn prediction model using classification algorithms.
- Deployed the model as a REST API using FastAPI on a virtual machine.

### Week 6: FastAPI + Streamlit + Docker-Compose
- Built a full-stack ML app with:
  - **FastAPI** backend for serving model predictions.
  - **Streamlit** frontend for user interaction.
  - **Docker Compose** to orchestrate the services.

### Week 7: FastAPI, Docker, and Terraform Deployment
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor on advertising data.
- Containerized the model with Docker and deployed the API.
- Used **Terraform** to automate infrastructure provisioning.

### Week 8: Scikit-learn Pipelines & Deployment
- Built an ML pipeline using Scikit-learn transformers and encoders.
- Deployed the model via a **FastAPI** container on port `8502`.

### Week 9: Ansible Automation
- Set up a Jenkins container as an **Ansible** controller.
- Installed and configured **Apache** web servers in test and prod environments.
- Customized servers to display developer name and environment label.

## üìÅ Final Project (Bank Marketing Prediction)

The final project integrates the full MLOps pipeline:
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training (VotingClassifier).
- Containerized **FastAPI** application deployed on **AWS EC2**.
- Infrastructure provisioned via **Terraform** and configured with **Ansible**.
- Swagger UI used for interactive testing.
