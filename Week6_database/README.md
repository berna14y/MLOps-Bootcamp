# Churn Prediction API

## Project Overview

This churn prediction API uses a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave a bank. It leverages customer data such as Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, Credit Card possession, Membership Activity, and Estimated Salary. The API is developed using FastAPI and is deployed on a virtual machine (VM) environment.

### Installation

##### Creating the Environment
Create a new Conda environment to manage the project's dependencies:

conda create -n churn_api_env python=3.9
conda activate churn_api_env


##### Installing Dependencies

Install all required packages specified in the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Project Files
Ensure that your project folder has the following files:

main.py: Contains the FastAPI application logic.
requirements.txt: Lists all the necessary Python libraries.
model.pkl: The trained machine learning model (ensure this is in the correct directory or update the path in main.py).

### Usage

##### Running the Application
Start the FastAPI server with the following command:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

This command will host the API on the virtual machine's IP, making it accessible through the specified port.

##### Accessing the API Documentation
Once the server is running, the API documentation generated by FastAPI can be accessed via: http://<VM_IP>:8000/docs

Replace <VM_IP> with the actual IP address of your virtual machine if accessing from a different machine.

##### Interacting with the API
Follow the interactive documentation to try out the API. You can send a POST request to the endpoint /prediction/churn with JSON payload as specified in the documentation. Hereâ€™s an example payload:

{
  "CreditScore": 650,
  "Age": 34,
  "Tenure": 3,
  "Balance": 50000,
  "NumOfProducts": 2,
  "HasCrCard": 1,
  "IsActiveMember": 1,
  "EstimatedSalary": 60000,
  "Geography_France": 1,
  "Geography_Germany": 0,
  "Geography_Spain": 0,
  "Gender_Female": 0,
  "Gender_Male": 1
}
